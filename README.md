# SenseHatScripts
A Collection of super simple scripts I wrote years ago for the Raspberry Pi's SenseHat module.

Feel free to use and modify these however you want! 
FOSS baby!

note - Just moving these over from my old profile, i changed handles a while ago and wanted all my stuff on the same page..
